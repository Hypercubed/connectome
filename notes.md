I. For my favourite cell X. Eg. hepatocyte - what are the top ligands and receptors that hepatocytes express?
  A. top 5-10 defined as most specific

    [same as 1ii except "most specific" is tbd]

  B. top 5-10 most highly expressed (I think this is less interesting than ii)

    a) Clear the visualization.
      1) Right click on the visualiation area.
      2) Select "celar visulization"
    b) In the samples tab search for hepatocytes
      1) Click on Samples or the tab on the right to open the display panel.
      2) Click the down arrow on the upper right to open the search box.
      3) Type "hepatocyte" (without quotes)
    c) Click teh visible icon (eye)
    d) In the visualization right click on the hepatocyte node.
    e) click on show -> top expressed ligands.
    f) again for show -> top  expressed receptors.
    g) the visualization will show the top ligand and receptor genes and any ligand receptor egdes.

II. For a given receptor-ligand pair, which cells are communicating the most?
  A. CSF1 - CSF1R - figure 4

    a) Clear the visualization.
    x) In the options tab, Set edge cutoff to 0.1.
    b) Select the pairs tab.
    c) clear all pairs.
      1) Click the selct all button.
      2) Click on the visible icon (eye) to turn off all pairs.
    d) in the pairs tab search for "CSF1"
    e) Turn on the CSF2_CSF2R pair and corresponding genes.  You will see the pair edge displayed.
    g) Turn on all samples in the samples tab.
    f) hive plot shows samples ranked by expression, swicth to force directed. 

  B. KITLG - KIT


III. For a pair of cells (eg. Mast cells and Keratinocyte Epidermal) what are the top 5-10 pathways for communicating between them?

  a) Clear the visualization.
  b) In the samples tab search for and visualize Mast cells and Keratinocyte Epidermal.
