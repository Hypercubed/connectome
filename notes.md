I. For my favourite cell X. Eg. hepatocyte - what are the top ligands and receptors that hepatocytes express?
  A. top 5-10 defined as most specific

    [same as 1ii except "most specific" is tbd]

  B. top 5-10 most highly expressed (I think this is less interesting than ii)

    a) Clear the visualization.
      1) Right click on the visualiation area.
      2) Select "Clear Visulization"
    b) In the samples tab search for "hepatocyte"
      1) Click on Samples or the tab on the right to open the display panel.
      2) Click the down arrow on the upper right to open the search box.
      3) Type "hepatocyte" (without quotes)
    c) Click the visible icon (eye)
    d) In the visualization right click on the hepatocyte node.
    e) click on show -> top expressed ligands.
    f) again for show -> top  expressed receptors.
    g) the visualization will show the top ligand and receptor genes and  ligand receptor egdes.

II. For a given receptor-ligand pair, which cells are communicating the most?
  A. CSF1 - CSF1R - figure 4

    a) Clear the visualization.
    b) Select the pairs tab.
    e) Search for "CSF1"
    f) Turn on the CSF2 and CSF2R genes.  You will see the pair edge displayed.
    g) Right click on the ligand-receptor pair edge, select show -> Top Paths.
    h) hive plot shows samples ranked by expression product.
    i) switch to force direct graph to view product values

  B. KITLG - KIT

    [same as IIA]

III. For a pair of cells (eg. Mast cells and Keratinocyte Epidermal) what are the top 5-10 pathways for communicating between them?

  a) Clear the visualization.
  b) In the samples tab search for and visualize Mast cells and Keratinocyte Epidermal.
  c) Right click and slect "Show top paths for all visible cells"
