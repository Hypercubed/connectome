# Introduction

We developed the on-line connectome visualization application described in this paper using various open source and custom tools.  The vector graphic visualization is generated using the [D3.js visualization library][d3].  The application interface was developed using the [AngularJS web application framework][angular] and the [twitter bootstrap front-end framework][twbs].

The visualization interface takes the the expression files generated in this study [cross reference to supplemental material] along with other metadata in tabular format [cross reference to supplemental material?] to generate the network/hive visualization as shown in figure XX.
